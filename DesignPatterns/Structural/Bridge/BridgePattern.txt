There are two Entities Basically

1. Abstraction
2. Implementor

Abstraction contains a reference to the Implementor Interface.
This allows the two to be independently developed without the one being concerned about the another.

The code changes will be very minimal in the case where we want to add additional classes in the implementor.

Use Bridge Pattern when
1. To reduce the explotion of classes.
2. Decide at the runtime which implementation of the interface to choose for a particular refined Abstraction.
