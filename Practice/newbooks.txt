Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request 
from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Later, the object in the chain will decide 
themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next 
object in the chain or not.This pattern is recommended when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesn’t have to be a specific object.
Also, handler is determined at runtime. Please note that that a request not handled at all by any handler is a valid use case.
